1. Make sure you object has a collider
2. Assign an Item script on your object
3. In the inspector and on the script Item, Assign a unique number in the ID field (Can be anything As long as its not the same as another item)
4. Assign the maximum ammount this item can be in 1 slot of the inventory in the Max Stack field.
5. If your planning to make a UI with these script, Theres a sprite field for convenience.

To use the inventory system, simply add it to your player object or something else and assign the number of slot the inventory will have.


How to use in code:

Grab the InventorySystem component (Usually with GetComponent)
Call either AddItem or remove Item and pass the Item component of your object with the ammount you want to Add/Remove.
